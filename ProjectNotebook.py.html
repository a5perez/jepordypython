# # Project Description

# Here I created a jepordy game! The topics in this game are: colors, math, ucsd and pets. There are levels for every category. For every correct answer, you will get a certain amount of points. For every question answered wrong, you will not be given points. 
# 
# Note that projects should be self-sufficient, so make sure to provide enough information and context here for someone to understand what you are doing in your project, and why. 

# ## Project Code
# 
# If it makes sense for your project, you can have code and outputs here in the notebook as well.

# In[13]:


from my_module.jepordypython import user_interaction

from my_module.jepordypython import game_responce

from my_module.jepordypython import check_answer

points = 0
picked = []

for x in range(3):
    print("------\nTURN " + str(x + 1))
    
    category, difficulty = user_interaction(picked)
    
    answer, rad = game_responce(category, difficulty, picked)
    
    points = check_answer(answer, rad, category, difficulty, points)

# #### Extra Credit (*optional*)

# Replace all of this text with a brief explanation (~3 sentences) of: 
# 
# I have no experience with python, this is my first programing class. Having never programed before I decied to tackle a chat-box jepordy game. I went above and beyond by creating a program that allows users to interact and provide a collective points system as well. I ensured that users cannot pick the same question twice. I challenged myself by creating a code that randomly distributes possible answers for a question. Each time a user runs through the game, the correct answer will be in a different location.
